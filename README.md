Modified Agency jekyll-theme based on [Agency bootstrap theme ](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/)

## What?
I was to design and chair an MUN so... Made this up.

Used a lot of borrowed js. [Like the ticker](https://www.sitepoint.com/build-javascript-countdown-timer-no-dependencies/)

Deployed with the excellent [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Same old CC logo and stuff.
Licenses in the folder.
